/**
 * ProvidersManager handles the complete lifecycle of service providers in an AdonisJS application.
 * It manages provider registration, booting, starting, readying, and shutdown phases.
 *
 * Service providers are classes that register services, bind dependencies, and set up
 * application components during different phases of the application lifecycle.
 *
 * Lifecycle phases:
 * 1. **Register**: Bind services to the IoC container
 * 2. **Boot**: Initialize services after all providers are registered
 * 3. **Start**: Start services (e.g., HTTP server, background jobs)
 * 4. **Ready**: Notify services that application is ready to serve requests
 * 5. **Shutdown**: Gracefully shutdown services during app termination
 *
 * @example
 * const manager = new ProvidersManager({ environment: 'web', providersState: [app] })
 * manager.use([
 *   { file: () => import('./providers/app_provider'), environment: ['web', 'console'] }
 * ])
 * await manager.register()
 * await manager.boot()
 * await manager.start()
 * await manager.ready()
